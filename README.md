## setup-dkml: Auto-generating GitHub and GitLab releases for OCaml native executables

With setup-dkml you can build and automatically create releases of OCaml native executables.
In contrast to the conventional [setup-ocaml](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/set-up-ocaml) GitHub Action:

| `setup-dkml`                         | `setup-ocaml`          | Consequence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dkml-base-compiler                   | ocaml-base-compiler    | `setup-dkml` **only supports 4.12.1 today**. `setup-ocaml` supports all versions and variants of OCaml                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| GitHub child workflow                | GitHub Action          | `setup-dkml` is more complex to configure, and takes longer to run                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| MSVC + MSYS2                         | GCC + Cygwin           | On Windows `setup-dkml` can let your native code use ordinary Windows libraries without ABI conflicts. You can also distribute your executables without the license headache of redistributing or statically linking `libgcc_s_seh` and `libstdc++`                                                        |
| dkml-base-compiler                   | ocaml-base-compiler    | On macOS, `setup-dkml` cross-compiles to ARM64 with `dune -x darwin_arm64`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| CentOS 7 and Linux distros from 2014 | Latest Ubuntu          | On Linux, `setup-dkml` builds with an old GLIBC. `setup-dkml` dynamically linked Linux executables will be highly portable as GLIBC compatibility issues should be rare, and compatible with the unmodified LGPL license used by common OCaml dependencies like [GNU MP](https://gmplib.org/manual/Copying) |
| 0 yrs                                | 4 yrs                  | `setup-ocaml` is officially supported and well-tested.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Some pinned packages                 | No packages pinned     | `setup-dkml`, for some packages, must pin the version so that cross-platform patches (especially for Windows) are available. With `setup-ocaml` you are free to use any version of any package                                                                                                             |
| diskuv/diskuv-opam-repository        | fdopen/opam-repository | Custom patches for Windows are sometimes needed. `setup-dkml` uses a much smaller set of patches. `setup-ocaml` uses a large but deprecated set of patches.                                                                                                                                                |

> Put simply, use `setup-dkml` when you are distributing executables or libraries to the public. Use `setup-ocaml` for all other needs.

`setup-dkml` will setup the following OCaml build environments for you:

| ABIs                       | Native `ocamlopt` compiler supports building executables for the following operating systems:                                            |

> **[1]** See [Distributing your Windows executables](#distributing-your-windows-executables) for further details

> **[2]** Cross-compiling typically requires that you use Dune to build all your OCaml package dependencies.
> [opam monorepo](https://github.com/ocamllabs/opam-monorepo#readme) makes it easy to do exactly that.
> Alternatively you can directly use [findlib toolchains](http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/dl/findlib-1.9.3/doc/ref-html/r865.html).

You will need three sections in your GitHub Actions `.yml` file to build your executables:

1. A `setup-dkml` workflow to create the above build environments
2. A "matrix build" workflow to build your OCaml native executables on each
3. A "release" workflow to assemble all of your native executables into a single release

You can follow the three sections on this page, or you can copy one of the examples:

| Example                                                                                      | Who For                                                                                                                                         |

### Steps for both GitLab and GitHub

FIRST, add a dependency to `dkml-workflows` in your project.

- For projects using `dune-project`:
  1. Add the following to `dune-project`:
     ```scheme
     (package
       ; ...
       (dkml-workflows
         (and
          (>= 1.0.0)
          :build))
       ...
     )
     ```
  2. Then do `dune build *.opam`
- For projects not using `dune-project`:
  1. Add the following to your `<project>.opam`:
     ```
     # ...
     depends: [
       "ocaml"
       "dune" {>= "2.9"}
       "dkml-workflows" {>= "1.0.0" & build}
     ]
     # ...
     ```

SECOND, update your Opam switch with the new `dkml-workflows` dependency:

```
opam install . --deps-only
```

THIRD, generate scaffolding files:

```
opam exec -- generate-setup-dkml-scaffold.exe
```

FOURTH, add the scaffolding files to your source control. Assuming you use git, it would be:

```
git add ci/setup-dkml
```

### GitLab

> macOS runners are not available in the GitLab CI/CD shared fleet unless
> you apply and are approved at
> https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runner-saas-macos-access-requests/-/issues/new . More details are
> available at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runner-saas-macos-access-requests/-/blob/main/README.md


### GitHub





#### Job 1: Define the `setup-dkml` workflow

Add the `setup-dkml` child workflow to your own GitHub Actions `.yml` file:

```yaml
jobs:
  setup-dkml:
    uses: 'diskuv/dkml-workflows/.github/workflows/setup-dkml.yml@v1'
    permissions:
      #   By explicitly setting at least one permission, all other permissions
      #   are set to none. setup-dkml.yml does not need access to your code!
      #   Verify in 'Set up job > GITHUB_TOKEN permissions'.
      actions: none
    with:
      ocaml-compiler: 4.12.1
```

`setup-dkml` will create an Opam switch containing an OCaml compiler based on the dkml-base-compiler packages.
Only OCaml `ocaml-compiler: 4.12.1` is supported today.

> **Advanced**
>
> The switch will have an Opam variable `ocaml-ci=true` that can be used in Opam filter expressions for advanced optimizations like:
>
> ```c
> [ "make" "rebuild-expensive-assets-from-scratch" ]    {ocaml-ci}
> [ "make" "download-assets-from-last-github-release" ] {!ocaml-ci}
> ```

#### Job 2: Define a matrix build workflow

You can copy and paste the following:

```yaml
jobs:
  setup-dkml:
    # ...
  build:
    # Wait until `setup-dkml` is finished
    needs: setup-dkml

    # Five (5) build environments will be available. You can include
    # all of them or a subset of them.
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        include:
          - gh_os: windows-2019
            abi_pattern: win32-windows_x86
            dkml_host_abi: windows_x86

            msys2_packages: mingw-w64-i686-pkg-config
          - gh_os: windows-2019
            abi_pattern: win32-windows_x86_64
            dkml_host_abi: windows_x86_64
            opam_root: D:/.opam
            gh_unix_shell: msys2 {0}
            msys2_system: CLANG64
            msys2_packages: mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-pkg-config
          - gh_os: macos-latest
            abi_pattern: macos-darwin_all
            dkml_host_abi: darwin_x86_64
            opam_root: /Users/runner/.opam
            gh_unix_shell: sh
          - gh_os: ubuntu-latest
            abi_pattern: manylinux2014-linux_x86
            dkml_host_abi: linux_x86

            dkml_host_abi: linux_x86_64
            opam_root: .ci/opamroot
            gh_unix_shell: sh

    runs-on: ${{ matrix.gh_os }}
    name: build-${{ matrix.abi_pattern }}

    # Use a Unix shell by default, even on Windows
    defaults:
      run:
        shell: ${{ matrix.gh_unix_shell }}

    steps:
      # Checkout your source code however you'd like. Typically it is:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install MSYS2 to provide Unix shell (Windows only)
        if: startsWith(matrix.dkml_host_abi, 'windows')
        uses: msys2/setup-msys2@v2
        with:
          msystem: ${{ matrix.msys2_system }}
          update: true
          install: >-
            ${{ matrix.msys2_packages }}
            wget
            make
            rsync
            diffutils
            patch
            unzip
            git
            tar

      - name: Download setup-dkml artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: .ci/dist

      - name: Import build environments from setup-dkml
        run: |
          ${{ needs.setup-dkml.outputs.import_func }}
          import ${{ matrix.abi_pattern }}

      - name: Cache Opam downloads by host
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: ${{ matrix.opam_root }}/download-cache
          key: ${{ matrix.dkml_host_abi }}

      # >>>>>>>>>>>>>
      # You can customize the next two steps!
      # >>>>>>>>>>>>>

      - name: Use opamrun to build your executable
        run: |
          #!/bin/sh
          set -eufx
          opamrun install . --with-test --deps-only --yes
          opamrun exec -- dune build @install

          # Package up whatever you built
          mkdir dist
          tar cvfCz dist/${{ matrix.abi_pattern }}.tar.gz _build/install/default .

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: ${{ matrix.abi_pattern }}
          path: dist/${{ matrix.abi_pattern }}.tar.gz
```

The second last GitHub step ("Use opamrun to build your executable") should be custom to your application.

#### Job 3: Define a release workflow

You can copy and paste the following:

```yaml
jobs:
  setup-dkml:
    # ...
  build:
    # ...
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write # Needed for softprops/action-gh-release@v1
    # Wait until `build` complete
    needs:
      - build
    steps:
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: dist

      - name: Remove setup artifacts
        run: rm -rf setup-*
        working-directory: dist

      - name: Display files downloaded
        run: ls -R
        working-directory: dist

      # >>>>>>>>>>>>>
      # You can customize the next two steps!
      # >>>>>>>>>>>>>

      - name: Release (only when Git tag pushed)
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
        if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
        with:
          files: |
            dist/*
```

#### Distributing your executable

##### Distributing your Windows executables

Since your executable has been compiled with the Microsoft Visual Studio
Compiler (MSVC), your executable will require that the Visual Studio
Runtime (`vcruntime140.dll`) is available on your end-user's machine.

If your end-user recently purchased a Windows machine the Visual C++ Redistributable
will not be present; they would see the following if they tried to run your
executable:

![vcruntime140.dll is missing](images/vcruntime140_missing.png)

`vcruntime140.dll` and other DLLs that are linked into your executable
by Visual Studio are available as part of the
[Visual C++ Redistributable Packages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/redistributing-visual-cpp-files).

As of April 2022 the Redistributable Packages only support Windows Vista, 7,
8.1, 10, and 11. Windows XP is **not** supported.

To get the Redistributable Packages onto your end-user's
machine, do one of the following:

1. Ask your end-user to download from one of the links on (Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable latest supported downloads)[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist]. The end-user will need Administrator privileges.
2. Bundle your executable inside a standard Windows installer (NSIS, Wix, etc.). You can see NSIS instructions below. The end-user will need Administrator privileges.
3. Ask your user to download `vcruntime140.dll` and place it in the same
   directory as your executable. This is not recommended because Windows Update
   will not be able to apply any security updates to your locally deployed
   `vcruntime140.dll`.

---

If you choose option 2 and are using NSIS as your Windows installer, you can add
the following NSIS section to your NSIS configuration:

```nsis
Section "Visual C++ Redistributable Packages"
  SetOutPath "$INSTDIR"
  !include "x64.nsh"
  ${If} ${IsNativeAMD64}
    File "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Redist\MSVC\14.29.30133\vc_redist.x64.exe"
    ExecWait '"$INSTDIR\vc_redist.x64.exe" /install /passive'

When you run the `makensis.exe` NSIS compiler the specified `File` must be
present on the `makensis.exe` machine. Make sure you have set it correctly!
If the NSIS compiler is running
as part of the GitHub Actions, you can
look at the output of setup-dkml.yml's step
"Capture Visual Studio compiler environment (2/2)"; the directory will be
the `VCToolsRedistDir` environment variable. The `VCToolsRedistDir` environment
variable will also be available to use as
`opamrun exec -- sh -c 'echo $VCToolsRedistDir'`

### Advanced Usage

#### Job Inputs

##### CACHE_PREFIX

The prefix of the cache keys.

##### FDOPEN_OPAMEXE_BOOTSTRAP

Boolean.

Use opam.exe from fdopen on Windows. Typically only used when bootstrapping Opam for the first time. May be needed to solve '\"create_process\" failed on sleep: Bad file descriptor' which may need https://github.com/ocaml/opam/commit/417b97d8cfada35682a0f4107eb2e4f9e24fba91

#### Matrix Variables

##### gl_image

The GitLab virtual machine image for macOS. Examples: `macos-11-xcode-12`.

Linux always uses a [Docker-in-Docker image](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_docker_build.html#use-docker-in-docker).

##### gl_tags

GitLab CI/CD uses tags like
`[shared-windows, windows, windows-1809]` to specify the type of runner machine to use

##### gh_os

The GitHub Actions operating system.

##### bootstrap_opam_version

We need an old working Opam; see BOOTSTRAPPING.md of dkml-installer repository.
We use https://github.com/diskuv/dkml-installer-ocaml/releases
to get an old one; you specify its version number here.

Special value of 'os' means use the OS's package manager
(yum/apt/brew).

##### opam_root

OPAMROOT must be a subdirectory of GITHUB_WORKSPACE if running in
dockcross so that the Opam root (and switch) is visible in both the
parent and Docker context. Always specify this form as a relative
path under GITHUB_WORKSPACE.

When not using dockcross, it should be an absolute path to a
directory with a short length to minimize the 260 character
limit on Windows (macOS/XCode also has some small limit).

CAUTION: The opam_root MUST be in sync with outputs.import_func!

##### vsstudio_hostarch

Only needed if `gh_os: windows-*`. The ARCH in
`vsdevcmd.bat -host_arch=ARCH`. Example: x64.

If you have a 64-bit Intel machine you should not use x86 because
_WIN64 will be defined (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/preprocessor/predefined-macros?view=msvc-170)
which is based on the host machine architecture (unless you explicitly
cross-compile with different ARCHs; that is, -host_arch=x64 -arch=x75).
Confer: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170#use-the-developer-tools-in-an-existing-command-window

If you see ppx problems with missing _BitScanForward64 then
https://github.com/janestreet/base/blob/8993e35ba2e83e5020b2deb548253ef1e4a699d4/src/int_math_stubs.c#L25-L32
has been compiled with the wrong host architecture.

##### vsstudio_arch

Only needed if `gh_os: windows-*`. The ARCH in
`vsdevcmd.bat -arch=ARCH`. Example: x86.
Confer: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170#use-the-developer-tools-in-an-existing-command-window

##### vsstudio_<others>

Hardcodes details about Visual Studio rather than let DKML discover
a compatible Visual Studio installation.

Example:
  vsstudio_dir: 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Enterprise'
  vsstudio_vcvarsver: '14.16'
  vsstudio_winsdkver: '10.0.18362.0'
  vsstudio_msvspreference: 'VS16.5'
  vsstudio_cmakegenerator: 'Visual Studio 16 2019'

##### ocaml_options:

Space separated list of `ocaml-option-*` packages.

Use 32-bit installers when possible for maximum portability of
OCaml bytecode. Linux has difficulty with 32-bit (needs gcc-multilib, etc.)
macos is only the major platform without 32-bit.

You don't need to include `ocaml-option-32bit` because it is auto
chosen when the target ABI ends with x86.
